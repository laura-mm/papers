# Introduction
this is important for some effect and vectors and biomass.
see Haywood et al (2000).
measurements are to add to this body of knowledge using mass spectrometer data (allan et al 2001).

# simulations
john box model is consistent with colj as the dominant growth mechanism.

# methods
we used a mass spectrometer to measure aerosol mass and composition (smith et al 1998).
